                So far throughout my course, I have enjoyed and demonstrated determination by participating in group activities and had roles on various projects, this has created opportunities for me to develop team leadership skills and further my knowledge.

                I am devoted to get into this industry, it has long been my dream to learn and grow within a community of motivated and supportive people. I believe REA Group can offer that community that I desire.

                I am confident that I possess the skills, knowledge and personality required for the 2021 Graduate Software Development and Engineering program.
