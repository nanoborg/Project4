            <p>
                I have grown up with technology all my life. From playing Nintendo to building computers and working in the electrical industry. It's an integral component to my life with audio, video games, movies, photography, phones and the list is growing.
                <br>
                <br>
                Through my previous career as an Electrician, I got the chance to play around with hardware and software which just made me more inquisitive. I started to tear all my electronics at home apart to modify them, to make them more efficient, quieter, cooler, and run home-brew programs that they were not initially intended for. 
                <br>
                <br>
                I would say that's the key interest for me. I like technology because it's creative and it's progressive. It's always changing, there are no limits and that keeps it exciting for me.

                I am a recent graduate from General Assembly. In just 3 months of experience with the course I have been able to gain an insight into becoming a fullstack developer.
