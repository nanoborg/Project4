            <p>
                I have grown up with technology all my life. From playing Nintendo to building computers and working in the electrical industry. It's an integral component to my life with audio, video games, movies, photography, phones and the list is growing.
                <br>
                <br>
                Through my previous career as an Electrician, I got the chance to play around with hardware and software which just made me more inquisitive. I started to tear all my electronics at home apart to modify them, to make them more efficient, quieter, cooler, and run home-brew programs that they were not initially intended for. 
                <br>
                <br>
                I would say that's the key interest for me. I like technology because it's creative and it's progressive. Technology is always changing, there are no limits and that keeps it exciting for me.

                I am a recent graduate from General Assembly. In just 3 months of experience I have been able to gain an insight into becoming a full stack developer. The exercises and projects helped develop my programming fundamentals, researching skills, communication skills, project planning and deployment. 
                <br>
                <br>
                Using current developer tools and common practices i was able to understand the process of developing modern apps. Taking client side input and use the backend to process the input for API calls and render responses back to the client which you can check out on my main page.
                <br>
                <br>
                I had the opportunity to learn this by using multiple frameworks and libraries with 2 languages, ruby and javaScript.
                <br>
                <br>
                I am enjoying the process of learning. Coming from a trade based background, coding to me gives me the same sense of joy, constructing using my mind and hands which is very rewarding for me. I have a solid set of fundamentals that can allow me to continue to grow which makes excited for the future.
